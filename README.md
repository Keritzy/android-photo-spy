Photo Spy for Android
=====================

This is a small program to display the list of photos on your Android
device and then to display those photos to you. The interesting thing
is that it requires absolutely no system permissions to be able to do
so.

This app does not have [`INTERNET` permission][internet]. So it can
not send your images to anyone and is not a “true” spy. But given that
almost every Android app in the Market does in fact have `INTERNET`
permission, this is not much of a limitation.

According [an article][nyt] in the _Times_, iOS needs location permission
to be able to do the same, which is kind of confusing. Google
“declined to comment on how its Android operating system for mobile
devices handles this issue,” which is kind of wise under the
circumstances.
